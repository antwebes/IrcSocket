			/**********************************************************
			 * This example demonstrates the newly added feature for doing Data Streams over P2P 
			 * Every node now has a nodeConfiguration property called p2pDataMessaging, which is false by default.
			 * Owners can set this property to true for any node to have p2p Data Messaging.
			 * Nodes decide on runtime based on this property whether to send the data through server or p2p. 
			 * This is particularly useful when you do not want persistent messages e.g. cursor movement messages on a whiteboard.
			 * The messages over p2p will not be persistent and any user coming late won't be able to receive any p2p existing message
			 * sent over this node. Also, users under firewall or without an rtmfp connection or without having player 10.1 will not get any message
			 * over such a node.
			 * You can use dev console to change this properties in a node. I am also adding another file called NodeConfigSetUP, which you can use a seperate test app 
			 * to see the nodes and set/unset the p2pDataMessaging property.
			 * This build of 10.1 is a beta build and is given for testing to users, should you find any issues with this feature, please report to us.
			 * Make sure that you have 10.1 playerglobal as well as Flex Compiler option requiring player version set to 10.1. Also, download and install player 10.1 
			 * before using this example. Users with lower player version will need to update their player first before using stream multicast as well as p2p Data Messaging.
			 * Flash Player 10.1 can be downloaded from adobe labs.
